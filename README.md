This repository contains the necessary resources and code for creating a narrative-driven walking experience focused on biodiversity and aimed at educating children about the unique features of their surroundings. The project incorporates mobile spatial technology and gamification elements similar to Pokemon Go to engage users, particularly the younger generation, in outdoor activities and foster a connection with nature.

## Purpose

The main goal of this project is to create an interactive and educational walking experience that motivates children to explore nature and learn about biodiversity. By incorporating indicator species as main characters in a narrative-driven app, users can engage with the app by capturing the species as they appear in their respective habitats. The app will also provide information about the species and their ecological importance, contributing to the users' understanding of the ecosystem.

The project takes inspiration from the Zeven Dwergenpad in Overloon, which successfully gamified a walking trail to attract children's attention and provide an entertaining experience. In this project, presence of birds species in different areas, such as residential, forested, agricultural, and water bodies, will be simulated. Additionally, habitats and other landscape features can be collected and explored within the app, further enriching the users' understanding of the ecosystem.

To achieve this, the project utilizes GIS technology to capture data on points of interest along the walking trail. This data-driven approach enables the creation of a fantasy-themed narrative that immerses children in an educational and captivating experience centered around biodiversity and the unique features of their surroundings.

## Folders

The repository is structured into the following folders:

### data

This folder contains the data used for the project, including AudioMoths recordings and forest LiDAR point clouds. These datasets are essential for analyzing and understanding the habitats and biodiversity in the study area.

### imgs

The "imgs" folder contains fieldwork images captured during the project. These images serve as visual references and documentation of the study area and the indicator species present.

### python

The "python" folder contains the scripts used for detecting bird species and visualizing the collected data. These scripts are written in Python and provide the necessary functionalities to process and analyze the data related to indicator species.

### results

The "results" folder holds the output of the analysis conducted as part of the project. This includes the birds detected during the study, as well as generated figures and visualizations. These results provide insights into the biodiversity of the study area and contribute to the educational value of the walking experience.

### documentation

The "documentation" folder contains the case description and the data management plan for the project. The case description outlines the objectives and scope of the walking experience, while the data management plan provides guidance on handling and storing the collected data.
